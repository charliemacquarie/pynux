## Configuration

To configure pynux, you will need to create a file named `.pynuxrc`. You can use a simple text editor to create the file. In a Windows OS, the file should be placed in `C:\Users\Username\`. In a Mac OS, the file should be placed in `~/.pynuxrc` (open a terminal window and type `open .` for the correct location).   

It may be advisable to `chmod 600 .pynuxrc`.

The following is an example default configuration that can be copied-and-pasted into the `.pynuxrc` file:

```ini
[nuxeo_account]
user = Administrator
password = Administrator

[rest_api]
base = http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/site/api/v1
X-NXDocumentProperties = dublincore
# for developers on the UCLDC project; use
# X-NXDocumentProperties = dublincore,ucldc_schema,picture

[platform_importer]
base = http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/site/fileImporter
```

To begin using pynux, use the specific configuration indicated below.  Contact your Nuxeo Administrator for user and password details:

```ini
[nuxeo_account]
user = 
password = 

[rest_api]
base = https://nuxeo.cdlib.org/nuxeo/site/api/v1
# X-NXDocumentProperties = dublincore
# for developers on the UCLDC project; use
X-NXDocumentProperties = dublincore,ucldc_schema,picture
 
[platform_importer]
base = https://nuxeo.cdlib.org/nuxeo/site/fileImporter
```
